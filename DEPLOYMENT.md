# 🚀 Deployment Guide - Netlify with Email Service

This guide will help you deploy your portfolio to Netlify with a fully functional contact form using Gmail SMTP.

---

## 📋 Prerequisites

1. **GitHub Account** (to push your code)
2. **Netlify Account** (free at [netlify.com](https://netlify.com))
3. **Gmail App Password** (already configured: `mwwi pcqj srfr drur`)

---

## 🎯 Step-by-Step Deployment

### Step 1: Push Your Code to GitHub

1. **Initialize Git** (if not already done):
   ```bash
   cd d:\Portfolio\project
   git init
   ```

2. **Add all files**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Portfolio with contact form"
   ```

4. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new)
   - Name it: `harshit-portfolio` (or any name)
   - Don't initialize with README (you already have files)
   - Click "Create repository"

5. **Push to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/harshit-portfolio.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```

---

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify

#### Option A: Deploy via Netlify Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Login to Netlify**:
   - Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Login with your GitHub account

2. **Create New Site**:
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Choose "GitHub"
   - Authorize Netlify to access your repositories
   - Select your `harshit-portfolio` repository

3. **Configure Build Settings**:
   - **Branch to deploy**: `main`
   - **Build command**: `npm run build`
   - **Publish directory**: `dist`
   - Netlify will auto-detect these from `netlify.toml` ✅

4. **Click "Deploy site"**
   - Netlify will assign you a random URL like: `random-name-123.netlify.app`

#### Option B: Deploy via Netlify CLI

```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm install -g netlify-cli

# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy
cd d:\Portfolio\project
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables (CRITICAL!)

Your contact form **will NOT work** without these environment variables!

1. **Go to Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Open your site
   - Click "Site configuration" → "Environment variables"

2. **Add the following variables**:

   | Variable | Value |
   |----------|-------|
   | `SMTP_HOST` | `smtp.gmail.com` |
   | `SMTP_PORT` | `465` |
   | `SMTP_USER` | `kulharshit21@gmail.com` |
   | `SMTP_PASS` | `mwwi pcqj srfr drur` |
   | `RECIPIENT` | `kulharshit21@gmail.com` |

3. **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: After adding environment variables, you MUST redeploy:
   - Go to "Deploys" tab
   - Click "Trigger deploy" → "Deploy site"

---

### Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

1. **In Netlify Dashboard**:
   - Go to "Domain management"
   - Click "Add custom domain"
   - Enter your domain (e.g., `harshitkulkarni.com`)

2. **Update DNS Records**: (if you own a domain)
   - Add Netlify's nameservers or
   - Add A/CNAME records to point to Netlify

---

## 🧪 Testing Your Deployment

### 1. Test the Website
- Visit your Netlify URL: `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- Check all sections load correctly
- Verify navigation works

### 2. Test Contact Form (CRITICAL!)
1. Navigate to the Contact section
2. Fill out the form with test data
3. Submit the form
4. **Expected Results**:
   - ✅ Success message appears
   - ✅ You receive an email at `kulharshit21@gmail.com`
   - ✅ The sender receives an auto-reply email

### 3. Check Netlify Function Logs
- Go to Netlify Dashboard → "Functions" tab
- Click on `contact` function
- View logs to debug any issues

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Issue 1: Contact form says "Failed to send"
**Solution**:
- Check if environment variables are set correctly
- Redeploy after adding environment variables
- Check Function logs in Netlify dashboard

### Issue 2: Emails not sending
**Solution**:
- Verify Gmail App Password is correct: `mwwi pcqj srfr drur`
- Ensure `SMTP_PORT` is `465` (not 587)
- Check if Gmail account has "Less secure app access" enabled (if needed)

### Issue 3: Build failed
**Solution**:
- Check build logs in Netlify
- Ensure `package.json` has all dependencies
- Try building locally: `npm run build`

### Issue 4: 404 errors on page refresh
**Solution**:
- Already handled by `netlify.toml` redirects ✅
- All routes redirect to `index.html` (SPA behavior)

## 🔐 Security Notes

1. **Never commit `.env` files** to GitHub ✅ (Already in `.gitignore`)
2. **Use environment variables** in Netlify Dashboard for secrets ✅
